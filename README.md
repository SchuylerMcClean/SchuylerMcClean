## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Schuyler!

I am a 20 year old software developer from Toronto, Ontario in Canada. I am currently in the second year of my Honours Computer Science program at the University of Guelph. In addition, I am minoring in Mathematics. I have been programming since 2021 when I discovered a passion for coding when I learned python in my grade 11 high school computer science course. I enjoy building personal projects and hope to gain professional experience in the near future!
