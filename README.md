## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Schuyler!

I am a software engineer from Toronto, Ontario in Canada. I am an Honours Computer Science Co-op student at the University of Guelph pursuing an emphasis in Artificial Intelligence and a Minor in Mathematics/Statistics. I have been programming since I developed a passion in my grade 11 high school computer science course. I enjoy learning, building projects, and challenging myself with new technologies. Many of my projects can be viewed on this profile!
